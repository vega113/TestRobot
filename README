A sample that shows how to use Active Robot API. It consists from a servlet and a robot. The servlet listens on URL and when hit uses the WIAB Robot to create a new wave.
The Servlet accepts the following parameters:
username: A waveinabox.net username.
message: A custom message.
To test:
Paste the following URL into your browser.
http://waveaids.appspot.com/createwave?username=<your waveinabox.net user name without domain>&message=<your message>

For example: http://waveaids.appspot.com/createwave?username=yuri&message=Hello_World

Note: To create a robot you will need the latest robot client jars. The Robot API is now part of the Apache Wave project and the client can be created by running the following command from the Apache Wave project root folder: 
ant release-robot-client-api
